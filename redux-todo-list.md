SETUP:
- create react app
- npm install redux react-redux
- start the app ( to check for errors )
- create store.js -> copy example from reader (add devtools)
- make a reducer.js -> function that returns state, set initial state
- import store to index.js, and use Provider to `provide` it to your app

Check yourself -> have a look at redux devtools to check initial state
